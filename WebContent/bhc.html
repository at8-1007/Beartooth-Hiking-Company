Founded in June 2018, our team of expert hiking guides have transformed couch potatoes into outdoor enthusiasts. Here you can find various hiking tours and pricing information for all your hiking needs in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness. If you're a fan of fun, adventure, and brilliant sights, you've come to the right place!
	<br/><br/>
	Spanning over 940,000 acres between Montana and Wyoming, the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness is home to two gorgeous mountain ranges differing in geological type, hundreds of stunning lakes, high-rolling plateaus, and deep, glacier-carved valleys. Known for its bear tooth resemblance, the Beartooth Range is a granitic formation while the Absaroka Range is of volcanic origin and is covered by dense forests and meadows. In the distance you may spot bighorn sheep, mountain goats, marmots, coyotes, black bears, grizzlies, and other animals. The Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness is part of the 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. You can learn more about the region by following the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/shoshone/recarea/?recid=80899" target="_blank">USDA Forest Service website</a>.
